"""
A package that is in charge of managing the scores file.
The scores file at this point will consist of only a number. That number is the accumulation of the
winnings of the user. Amount of points for winning a game is as follows:
POINTS_OF_WINNING = (DIFFICULTY X 3) + 5
Each time the user is winning a game, the points he won will be added to his current amount of
point saved in a file.
Methods
    1.  add_score - The functionâ€™s input is a variable called difficulty. The function will try to read
        the current score in the scores file, if it fails it will create a new one and will use it to save
        the current score.
